                <h2><u>PREDICTING EMPLOYEE ATTRITION IN A COMPANY</h2></u><br>
                <p>The proposal suggests creating a predictive model.<br>
                     This model would use a dataset containing various employee-related information and historical attrition records.
                      Machine learning technique Logistic Regression would be applied to identify attrition risk patterns. 
                      The model would be trained on historical data, evaluated using cross-validation, and shown to outperform rule-based methods.
                       The accuracy can be increased. By identifying at-risk employees early, companies could implement targeted retention efforts.
